        <p>Today i woke up at 7:30 AM and went to the physical education class. The class started at 8:00 AM, we did warm up exercises and after that trainer announced that today we are going to take exercise exam. The exam is we should squat 60 times in 1 minute. We heard about exam and divided to two groups girls and boys, then started working up by circle exercising 30 second work and then next workout type, we did it two times. After one hour we finished exercises and had some rest also prepared to the squat exam. My turn was last because of my surname first letter but it shouldn't be, the alphabetical order is russian not kazakh so my surname first letter goes to the end because of that.

            <br>Girls started squatting but i didn't pay attention so much but one thing i remembered it was one girl squatted 56 times in 1 minute. We were 3 boys and first dude started squatting he did 60 times and got my respect, second dude performed little so i didn't remember and pay attention.
            My turn trainer asked "Are you ready?" i said "yes" and started the timer. I'm squatting and trainer is counting, i'm aware that everyone is looking at me, because i'm the only one who left. I did it fast so to beat the 60 time result. Finally i squatted 65 times in 1 minute, i think girls was little shocked :). Also trainer said "good job! like every time", i think others understood that i'm passing all exams excellent and set the maximum result. Thats all, it was my today's morning.
